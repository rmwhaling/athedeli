        <h1>Baby vs. Lacey Swiss</h1>
            <p class="main-flexbox">The terms "baby Swiss" and "Lacey Swiss" refer to different types of Swiss cheese, each with its own unique characteristics.

                Baby Swiss:
                
                Baby Swiss cheese is a milder, creamier version of traditional Swiss cheese.
                It is typically made from cow's milk.
                Baby Swiss undergoes a shorter aging process compared to regular Swiss cheese, which contributes to its milder flavor and softer texture.
                The cheese has smaller and fewer holes (or "eyes") compared to traditional Swiss cheese.
                Baby Swiss is often preferred by those who enjoy the flavor of Swiss cheese but prefer a milder taste.

                <p>What Is Baby Swiss Cheese? Baby Swiss is a whole milk Swiss cheese made in America, specifically in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. It gets its name from its small size—it is a miniature version of Swiss cheese wheels.</p>
                </p>
                <p>Baby Swiss vs. Swiss: What’s the Difference?
                    Baby Swiss and regular Swiss cheese are similar in appearance, and both have a creamy texture, but there are slight differences between them:
                    
                    Cheese-making process: Baby Swiss and Swiss cheese have a similar cheese-making process, but baby Swiss is made in smaller batches. Baby Swiss cheese ages for a shorter time than aged Swiss cheese—traditional Swiss cheese ages for up to a year, while Baby Swiss only ages for a few months.
                    Appearance: Wheels of baby Swiss cheese are smaller than traditional Swiss cheese wheels. The small-batch production process of baby Swiss cheese yields smaller holes, or eyes, than Swiss cheese.
                    Flavor: Baby Swiss has a milder flavor than Swiss cheese.
                    Uses: Swiss cheese and baby Swiss are popular cheeses for sandwiches and are commonplace in grocery stores and deli counters. Swiss cheese is easy to melt and creates a good cheese “pull,” making it great for grilled cheese sandwiches. Baby Swiss is even softer, making it the best cheese for fondue, quiche, or mac and cheese recipes.</p>
                Lacey Swiss:
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                Lacey Swiss cheese is a variation of traditional Swiss cheese characterized by its open and holey texture.
                It has a mild and nutty flavor similar to regular Swiss cheese.
                Lacey Swiss cheese is distinguished by its numerous "eyes" or holes, which are larger and more irregularly shaped compared to those in traditional Swiss cheese.
                It is also made from cow's milk and typically has a semi-soft to firm texture.
                Lacey Swiss cheese is often used in sandwiches, salads, and as a table cheese due to its unique appearance and flavor.
                In summary, while both Baby Swiss and Lacey Swiss are variations of Swiss cheese, they differ in terms of flavor, texture, and appearance, with Baby Swiss being milder and creamier and Lacey Swiss having a more open and holey texture.</p>
                <p>Lacey Baby Swiss is also much softer and thinner than Baby Swiss. The taste is stronger than Baby Swiss, though still sweet and nutty. Sliced Lacey Baby Swiss looks like delicate sheets of lace and is lower in calories and salt than other types of Swiss cheese. It pairs best with dried fruits, nuts and sandwiches. </p>

                <p>What Is Lacy Swiss Cheese?
                    Lacy Swiss was invented by Alpine Lace Brands in 1985 in response to the growing need for healthier alternatives.  This cheese is closely related to Swiss cheese, but the whole milk used to produce swiss cheese is replaced with low fat milk to provide a healthier alternative with a lower fat content. It gets its name from the lacy appearance of the slices, which usually have a creamy, ivory color to them. It has a delightfully light and nutty flavor. If you follow a lactose-free diet, then this cheese is naturally free of lactose.
                    
                    How Should I Eat Lacy Swiss Cheese?
                    It’s a great table cheese but it is also delicious on deli sandwiches or to top off hamburgers and patty melts.  It’s rather light and delicate, so if you’re looking to add a true Swiss flavor to a recipe, our sharper imported varieties like Jarlsberg or Gruyere may be better choices.
                    
                    It melts very well, so it is a good option to use in quiches or pasta dishes when you want to add creaminess without too much fat. We also love it paired with dried fruits and nuts, so it’s a great addition to any cheeseboard, especially if you want to offer a healthier option. Try it with slices of apple or pear for a refreshing afternoon snack.
                    
                    What Is Lacy Baby Swiss?
                    We also stock Lacy Baby Swiss. This is another of our local selections. Lacy Baby Swiss is a young, semi-soft cheese distinguishable by its myriad of small holes. Baby Swiss is made by substituting water for the milk’s whey to slow bacterial action compared to a traditional Swiss Cheese. The Lacy version has smaller holes and a milder flavor, as well as the lower fat and sodium content found in Lacy Swiss.</p>
