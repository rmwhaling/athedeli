        <h2>Dry-cured</h2>
        <p>Dry-cured refers to a method of preserving and flavoring meat, typically pork, by applying a mixture of salt, sugar, and spices directly onto the meat's surface and allowing it to air-dry over a period of time. This process draws moisture out of the meat, inhibiting the growth of bacteria and effectively preserving it.

            <h2>Wet-cured</h2>
            
            <p>Wet-cured refers to a method of preserving and flavoring meat by submerging it in a liquid solution, known as a brine, which typically consists of water, salt, sugar, and various seasonings or spices. This process allows the meat to absorb moisture and flavor from the brine over a period of time.

            <h2>Water Added</h2>
            <p>"Water added" in deli ham production refers to a common practice where water is injected into the ham during processing. This process is also known as "enhancing" or "pumping" and is done primarily for several reasons.

                <p>"Uncured" means that a meat product has not undergone the traditional curing process using synthetic nitrates or nitrites. Curing is a preservation method that involves treating meats with salt, sugar, and curing agents like sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite to preserve the meat, enhance flavor, and inhibit bacterial growth.
